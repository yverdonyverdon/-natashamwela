    "Natasha's intricately detailed paintings probe and examine how clothing is policed on the bodies of minorities. She is inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, personal experiences, and the tragic killings of young,< unarmed, Black men wearing hoodies. Natasha delves into the politicization, criminalization, and the demonization of hoodies and tracksuits< on the bodies of Black people.",
    "Another central facet of Natasha's work focuses on body positivity, exploring what it means to be deemed as beautiful< in our society. She explores skin conditions such as vitiligo, stretch marks, and ageism. While deemed as imperfections to some or outright shameful to others, Natasha highlights how these unique markings are< what makes us human.",
    "As of recently, Natasha's work has taken more of a conceptual standpoint by integrating moving images,< imagination, and fine art. She has always had a keen interest in how these three things can intertwine together to tell a different narrative. She uses symbolism of faceless figures to challenge the viewersâ€™ preconceived perceptions and ideologies of what it means,< to occupy space as a migrant. Natasha sheds light on the deep-rooted realities of racism, discrimination, and marginalization in a post-colonial< oppressive system. Challenging her views on not only Africa's political past and present but its potential and future through her art."
